# Cruising: Is A Balcony Stateroom Worth The Extra Cost?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1065f897-3d35-46b2-af40-b657a700dae7.jpg)

Recently, I was able to experience a 7-night stay in balcony stateroom aboard Royal Caribbean's Allure of the Seas. This was my very first time in a room with a balcony aboard a ship, with my previous experiences in either an interior (no windows at all) or ocean view window (but no balcony) room. 

**So, did I like it? **  
Hell yes I did! 

**Would I book a balcony room on a future cruise? **  
I don't think I could ever go back to anything less.

**Was it worth the extra cost?**  
Here's where it gets a little complicated. Was it worth it for me, yes. 

Would you recommend it your friends and fellow would-be cruisers?
