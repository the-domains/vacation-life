# Cruising: Is A Balcony Stateroom Worth The Extra Cost?

Recently, I was able to experience a 7-night stay in balcony stateroom aboard Royal Caribbean's Allure of the Seas. This was my very first time in a room with a balcony aboard a cruise ship. My previous experiences were either in an interior (no windows at all) or ocean view window (but no balcony) room. So, did I like the balcony? Hell yes I did! Here's what I feel are the best parts, and one point of hesitation, that come with a balcony stateroom.

## The Good

**1) The view! Oh the view...**  
Most of the time I was out on the balcony, I was either people-watching from above at a bustling port in a new country, or enjoying a view of endless water and the ship gliding effortlessly through it. It also didn't matter whether it was daytime or nighttime, as I found myself opening that sliding door multiple times a day. Also available on the Oasis-class ships are inward-facing balcony rooms with a beautiful view of the onboard Central Park (yes, there is a park with trees and nature sounds on a ship at sea) or Boardwalk (complete with a working carousel!) areas, but I'll need to save comment on those until I have chance to stay in one.

**2) Fresh air anytime you want.**  
For those staying in an interior or ocean view window room, they are only able to experience the temperature controlled air from the ventilation systems. To get any fresh air, they have to walk out of their room to find somewhere exposed to the outside. All you have to do in your balcony room is unlock the sliding door and open it. Go ahead, there is a sensor that turns off your air conditioning while the door is open. Clever huh? Take a deep breath of the warm Caribbean ocean air while you're at it. Heaven.

**3) Bright natural lighting.**

Instead of the glow of lightbulbs being your only source of light inside the room, or a window only letting some light in, you have a huge glass door to let in all the sunlight you want. 

**4) A private dining area just for you.**  
Eating at the restaurants, dining rooms, and buffet are great in their own way. But if you're looking for a quiet, private dining area, I don't think there is any better place than right on your room balcony. Order room service, stay in your comfy clothes, and enjoy the food. You can even take a nap right after if you want because your bed is right there!

## So what's the bad?

You'd think with all of those awesome reasons, everybody would be booking balcony rooms. But there is one thing that may cause some hesitation -- the extra cost. Balcony rooms usually cost more than window-only and interior rooms, which is reasonable considering the extra space you're getting. I've seen the cost difference vary from 15% to 100%+ more depending on the room you are comparing it to, the sailing dates, and other variables. Wow, double the price? Might not be so worth it. 

In the end, that decision comes down to you, the cost of the booking you are considering, and what you are comfortable with paying for the benefits. But, I will say that if you have never stayed in a balcony stateroom, you should try at least once for the experience (and possibly get hooked for life haha!)

Happy cruising, vacationers!
