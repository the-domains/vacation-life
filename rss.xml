            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cruising: Is A Balcony Stateroom Worth The Extra Cost?</h1><h2>The Good</h2><p>1) The view! Oh the view...Most of the time I was out on the balcony, I was either people-watching from above at a bustling port in a new country, or enjoying a view of endless water and the ship gliding effortlessly through it. It also didn't matter whether it was daytime or nighttime, as I found myself opening that sliding door multiple times a day. Also available on the Oasis-class ships are inward-facing balcony rooms with a beautiful view of the onboard Central Park (yes, there is a park with trees and nature sounds on a ship at sea) or Boardwalk (complete with a working carousel!) areas, but I'll need to save comment on those until I have chance to stay in one.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9dc9ac04908ec9240c1515c25ef3b3aa7f294c8e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
